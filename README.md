# python-multiprocess
The only example of Python's mutiprocess you'll need.

You probably searched through the internet like I did and found that examples were not very useful.
You might have some following questions:

- Why is threading in Python slow?
- How to use multiprocessing in Python? map? pool?
- Why is multiprocessing still slow?
- Is there any example that shows multiprocessing is quicker than a single process?

Amend some code in the multiprocess.py and learn something!
